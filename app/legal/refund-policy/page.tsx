              take on provides real value and results for your business.
              <br />
              However, Infineteck understands that situations change. That‚Äôs why
              Infineteck‚Äôs teams have created a clear, fair and human first
              refund policy to help guide any unexpected issues with your

              Infineteck knows every software project is unique, just like your
              business. Our process is rooted in clarity and professionalism.
              That is why, before Infineteck begin any development, we go
              through:
            </p>
            <ul className="list-inside text-sm py-4">
              <li className="list-disc">‚úÖ A thorough discovery session</li>

            <p className="text-md">
              Once these steps are completed and mutually agreed upon, the
              project moves into execution by Infineteck.

            </h2>
            <p className="text-md">
              To kick off any project with Infineteck, we require an initial
              upfront payment. This confirms your commitment to the project and
              allows Infineteck‚Äôs team to allocate resources, including
              designers, developers, project managers and QA engineers to bring
              your vision to life. Whether you are based in Austin, New York,
              San Francisco or anywhere from the world, this Infineteck policy
              applies equally.

            </h2>
            <p className="text-md">
              Once Infineteck has received the upfront payment and the project
              has officially started, no refund will be issued. Here is why:
            </p>
            <ul>

                Infineteck immediately began allocating time, talent, and

                Milestones and deliverables are scheduled based on your specific

            </ul>
            <p className="text-md">
              Infineteck doesn't recycle templates or use shortcuts, your
              software is built from scratch, based on your approved SRS
              document.
              <br />
              That is why Infineteck can‚Äôt issue refunds once development is in
              motion.

            </h2>

            <p className="text-lg">
              Once your project is completed, tested and delivered, along with
              all source code, documentation and login credentials, you will not
              be eligible for a refund under any circumstance.
              <br />
              This includes:
            </p>

              Infineteck encourages all clients to thoroughly test the software
              before final delivery. Infineteck is always happy to fix bugs or
              make tweaks during the warranty period, but Infineteck cannot
              offer refunds once the files have been delivered.

            </h2>
            <p className="text-md">
              The only scenario where a refund may be considered is if
              Infineteck fails to deliver the software as outlined in the signed
              Software Requirement Specification (SRS) document. If a major
              deliverable is completely missing or the project was not built
              according to the scope detailed in the final SRS, even after
              giving Infineteck a chance to revise it, you may be eligible for a
              partial refund. To be clear, this applies only if:
            </p>

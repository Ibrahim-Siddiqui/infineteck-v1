                The world runs on software and engineers (or AI) are writing
                more code than ever. According to Business Research Insights,
                the global custom web application development market is expected
                to reach $90 billion by 2027. This means more businesses need

                The Role of Custom Web Application Development in Building
                Businesses
              </h3>
              <p className="text-lg md:text-xl font-light leading-8 my-5">
                Running and growing a business in the digital world is a lot
                more than having a ‘digital presence’ - it's about owning a
                digital platform that can work tirelessly behind the scenes for
                you, whenever and however your company needs it.
                <br />
                <blockquote className="border-l-4 text-lg font-medium italic leading-8 my-5 p-5 text-accent-color">
                  For instance, studies, like the one from Forrester Research,
                  shout loud and clear: a well-crafted user interface can
                  skyrocket your visit-to-order conversion rates up to 200%.
                </blockquote>
                This is where the transformative role of custom web applications
                for businesses kicks in.
                <br />
                Moreover, a survey by Adobe found that companies with strong and
                custom digital platforms enjoy a 2.5 times higher revenue growth
                rate compared to their counterparts relying on off-the-shelf
                solutions. This shows businesses can pivot from generic online
                spaces to dynamic, custom-built web applications and watch their
                engagement metrics soar.

                The Six Types of Web Applications
              </h3>
              <p className="text-lg md:text-xl font-light leading-8 my-5">
                Web applications can be categorized into six main types. Each
                type serves distinct purposes, catering to different user needs
                and business requirements. These are given below:
              </p>
              <h3 className="text-2xl font-bold my-5">1. Static Web Apps</h3>
              <p className="text-lg md:text-xl font-light leading-8 my-5">
                Often referred to as SPAs (Single Page Applications), static web
                apps function as basic websites on the internet. While not
                technically considered apps, they serve as platforms for
                displaying content.
                <br />
                An example is TwitchCon, a streaming platform that only consists
                of text, icons, and promotional videos.

              /> */}
              <h3 className="text-2xl font-bold my-5">2. Dynamic Web Apps</h3>
              <p className="text-lg md:text-xl font-light leading-8 my-5">
                Dynamic Web Apps are distinct from static ones as they generate
                data in real-time based on user requests to the server. Examples
                of dynamic web apps include Facebook (now Meta), which generated
                a staggering $131 billion in ad revenue in 2023 alone after
                evolving from a simple social network.
              </p>
              <h3 className="text-2xl font-bold my-5">
                3. E-commerce Platforms
              </h3>
              <p className="text-lg md:text-xl font-light leading-8 my-5">
                E-commerce web applications enable online payments and offer
                detailed product information, order tracking, shipping status
                updates, along with other convenient features to enhance the
                online shopping experience. Take Amazon.com, as one of the
                popular e-commerce platforms.

                4. Content Management Systems (CMS)
              </h3>
              <p className="text-lg md:text-xl font-light leading-8 my-5">
                A CMS serves as a centralized platform for organizing a
                website's content and resources. It acts as a repository where
                all materials are managed and stored, facilitating content
                delivery and publication. Popular CMS platforms like WordPress
                offer user-friendly interfaces for creating, editing, and
                managing website content efficiently.
              </p>
              {/* <Image

                alt="blog image"
              /> */}
              <h3 className="text-2xl font-bold my-5">
                5. Progressive Web Applications
              </h3>
              <p className="text-lg md:text-xl font-light leading-8 my-5">
                Progressive Web Applications (PWAs) are responsive apps that
                mimic the look, feel, and functionality of native mobile apps
                without requiring downloads or installations. Moreover, PWAs
                seamlessly transition between online and offline modes, offering
                users uninterrupted access to content and features. Take
                Pinterest.com for example.
              </p>

                src="/web-development-blog.png"

              /> */}
              <h3 className="text-2xl font-bold my-5">6. Portals</h3>
              <p className="text-lg md:text-xl font-light leading-8 my-5">
                It earns its name from serving as a singular access point for
                all visitors. Portal apps are beneficial for websites
                implementing paywalls, gating procedures, or requiring logins.
                This ensures controlled access to content and allows providers
                to manage user interactions effectively.
              </p>

              <h3 className="text-3xl font-bold my-5">
                Benefits of Custom Web Development
              </h3>
              <p className="text-lg md:text-xl font-light leading-8 my-5">
                It takes a mere 0.05 seconds for a user to form an opinion about
                a website’s excellence. This is where the multi-dimensional
                benefits of custom web development take the lead. Businesses can
                adapt to customer needs, streamline processes, improve business
                productivity, and stay ahead of the market demands more

                Web application development involves several stages, including

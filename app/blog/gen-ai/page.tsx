                Generative AI significantly enhances diagnostic accuracy and
                speed. AI-driven tools can analyze medical images, such as
                X-rays and MRIs, to detect abnormalities that may be missed by
                human eyes.
                <br />
                For example, PathAI's technology is revolutionizing pathology by
                using AI to analyze tissue samples and detect cancerous cells.
                <br />
                Their AI system can identify tumor characteristics and grade
                cancer severity, aiding pathologists in making informed
                decisions about patient care.

                AI's predictive analytics capabilities are revolutionizing
                disease prediction and patient outcomes. By analyzing patient
                data, AI can forecast disease outbreaks and progression.
                <br />A study by the Cleveland Clinic showed that AI algorithms
                could predict patient deterioration up to 48 hours before
                traditional methods, allowing for timely interventions and
                improved care.

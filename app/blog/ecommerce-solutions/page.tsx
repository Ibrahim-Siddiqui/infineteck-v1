              <strong>$8–8.5 trillion</strong> by 2026 (Reddit, Blue host). That
              means more buyers than ever are turning to shopping online and
              that the number keeps growing. For instance, mobile commerce alone
              is predicted to make up to{" "}
              <strong> 73% of total e-commerce sales globally</strong> by
              2024–2025 (Exploding Topics, Prime Penguin, Easy Data, Automatic

              <br />
              <br />
              For you, the message is clear: By 2025, not having a strong online
              storefront in 2025 is not just a missed opportunity; it’s a sign
              you are not doing things right.

              <li className="list-disc">Mobile-First, Always</li>
              <p className="text-lg">
                As consumers move to their phones, so must your store. According
                to studies, mobile first shoppers convert at a higher rate and
                expect quick, easy experiences. A one second delay can result in
                losing 10% in sales (Zoho).

              <li className="list-disc">AI & Automated Personalization</li>
              <p className="text-lg">
                Statistics have indicated almost 76% of shoppers expect
                personalized experiences and AIs could increase conversions by
                10–30% (source: Yellow ball). It’s no longer nice to have in an
                age when friendly Chabot’s and smart recommendation engines are
                all the rage.

                Integration of Social & Quick Commerce

              <p className="text-lg">
                There are now fertile grounds for total integration between
                social commerce and e-commerce: platforms like TikTok, Instagram
                and Facebook are expected to facilitate more than $1.2 trillion
                sales by 2025 (Simple Global, Yellow ball). And "quick

              <p className="text-lg">
                More than 68% of consumers shop online with eco-friendly brands
                as their first selection (Channel Engine). This means your
                e-commerce solution can be a story of ethical packaging, carbon

                Personalized Platform or Reliable Framework?
              </li>
              <p className="text-lg">
                Whether you are going Shopify, Magneto, Woo Commerce or even a
                sleek MERN stack, you need to be focused on speed, UX, and
                growth. Magneto is still considered a strong option for
                enterprise stores, increased performance thanks to their cloud
                infrastructure and catalogs powered by Elastic search and
                modular architecture (Channel Engine).

                Research shows average cart abandonment rates are 70%, with
                almost half the shoppers leaving the process because of
                unexpected shipping or transaction fees while they checkout
                (Reddit). Implementing smart shopping carts with one-click
                checkout functions, transparent pricing and checkout options
                like Apple Pay and local payment gateways will help recover lost
                sales.

                help with up to 90% of customer queries and increase conversions
                by one fifth to one third (Yellow ball). Effective solutions
                allow every browsing session to appear and feel personal,
                presenting customer’s offers or products they are more likely to
                love or gravitate to.

              Software as a Service (SaaS) is not only the term for a category
              of software. It is the model behind everything from your daily to
              do list application to billion dollar organizations. While some
              SaaS products have little further upside potential, some have no

              Knowing First: What Is a Scalable SaaS Product?
            </h2>
            <p className="text-lg">
              Before Infineteck goes too far down this road, let’s clear up some
              key terminology.
              <br />
              A SaaS product software as a service is an online application a
              user accesses over the web like Slack, Trello, Salesforce or
              Netflix. A scalable SaaS product is a product that can grow
              whether it is a growth of 10 users or 10 million users without it
              crashing, slowing down or costing you a fortune to maintain in the
              wake of its success.
              <br />
              Scalability is not only about the technology and how it performs.
              It also includes:
            </p>
            <ul className="list-inside text-lg py-4">
              <li className="list-disc">
                How quickly the product can adapt to user feedback
              </li>
              <li className="list-disc">
                The ability to support new features and modules
              </li>
              <li className="list-disc">
                Security will be tight as the amount of data grows
              </li>
              <li className="list-disc">
                Performance won’t need to be revisited constantly
              </li>
            </ul>
            <p className="text-lg">
              And that's where Infineteck does quite well.
            </p>
            <h2 className="text-2xl md:text-3xl py-4 font-semibold">
              Why Scalability Should Be Non Negotiable For Your Saas Idea
            </h2>

            <p className="text-lg">
              Let just say you have created a brand new platform, a productivity
              application, a niche specific CRM or your education portal. It
              works well out of the gate. Users love it but as the traffic
              grows, so does the data. You start seeing more users sign up and
              then breaks happen.
            </p>
            <ul className="list-inside text-lg py-4">
              <li className="list-disc">Pages load slowly</li>
              <li className="list-disc">Servers crash</li>
              <li className="list-disc">Bugs are present</li>
              <li className="list-disc">Customers churn</li>
            </ul>
            <p className="text-lg">
              That is why <strong>scalability</strong> should not be an option
              or a <strong>feature</strong>, it should be a base layer. Your
              success you create could become your downfall. At Infineteck, we
              do not code your features, Infineteck team design for your{" "}
              <strong>growth from day 01</strong>.

            </h3>
            <p className="text-lg">
              At Infineteck, we use a modular approach to architecture, breaking
              the system into smaller components that can be managed. Why pursue
              modularity? The benefits are:

              5. Always Performance Testing
            </h3>
            <p className="text-lg">
              Before any product is staged for launch, Infineteck performs
              stress tests, load balancing and failover recoveries to simulate
              how the product will actually be used in the real world, so when
              your product is presented for a demo or user testing, it will
              provide the best possible first experience. In the event that your
              product crashes the first time the demo is run your chances with
              investors, clients or customers may crash as well.
              <br />
              Infineteck protects you from that outcome, by ensuring that before
              we launch any product for a client Infineteck will run performance
              tests for:

              Infineteck has seen many times founders build fast, raise funding
